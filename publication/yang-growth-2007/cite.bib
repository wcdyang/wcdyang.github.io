 abstract = {The growth of carbon nanotube (CNT) using cobalt silicide as a catalyst and source/drain electrode is proposed to explore its feasibility for fabricating integrated-circuit process compatible, self-aligned CNT ﬁeld-eﬀect transistors (CNTFET). The silicide nanoparticles formed in the Ti/Co/poly-Si source/drain stack were used as a catalyst for CNT growth. Results show that single-walled CNTs have been synthesized between pre-deﬁned catalytic cobalt silicide source/drain pairs by chemical vapor deposition at 800–900 °C. Preliminary transistor characteristics of the CNTFETs have also been achieved.},
