 abstract = {The solution-based synthesis of quaternary Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) nanocrystals and further processing into a homogeneous photovoltaic absorber ﬁlm prove challenging due to the stability of binary and ternary chalcogenide compounds comprised of Cu, Zn, and Sn cations. In this contribution, CZTS nanocrystals are synthesized according to a previously reported synthesis recipe yielding devices with reported efﬁciencies as high as 7.2%. The particles are separated by size into two populations exhibiting size-correlated composition variations. This observation highlights the challenges in synthesizing quaternary CZTS nanoparticles with interparticle composition uniformity. Films of particles from each population are sintered in a selenium atmosphere and found to exhibit a notable degree of phase segregation in the ﬁnal ﬁlm, while a mixture of particles from both populations converts into a relatively homogeneous ﬁlm upon selenization. Devices fabricated from the two particle populations separately as well as the mixture of particles exhibit varying degrees of performance, with the mixed particle cells achieving total area efﬁciencies as high as 7.9%. A modiﬁed synthesis recipe producing CZTS particles with narrower composition variations is shown to produce devices with improved efﬁciencies up to 8.4%. Preliminary conclusions regarding the effect of nanocrystal heterogeneity on ﬁlm sintering and device performance are presented.},
