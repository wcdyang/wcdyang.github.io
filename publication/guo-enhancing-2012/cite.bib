 abstract = {The ability to alloy Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 with Ge provides a unique ability to band-gap engineer the absorber ﬁlm by controlling the relative cation ratios. In here, a preliminary study on adjusting the Ge to Sn ratio is shown to signiﬁcantly improve the device performance of CZTSSe thin ﬁlm solar cells. CZTGeSSe solar cell with total area power conversion efﬁciency as high as 8.4% has been realized using a nanocrystalbased thin ﬁlm deposition process. The selenized CZTGeSSe thin ﬁlm exhibits a bi-layer structure where the thin sintered large-grain layer could be responsible for the poor red-response in external quantum efﬁciency of the resulting solar cell.},
